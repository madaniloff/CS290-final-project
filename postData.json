Conductors are vital to the functionality of the entire Axiomatic Hivemind, and their primary responsibility is to gather energy, which they transmit to the rest of the Hivemind via an electromagnetic field. A conductor always acts within the best interests of the Hivemind. It knows no morals or mercy, and it may gather this energy from any source that will produce it. Conductors typically seek out areas where immensely powerful beings dwell or where major events are taking place, where they then extract energy with frightening precision and efficiency.",
        "Life is one of the most efficient sources of energy, and conductors are exceptionally well-equipped to take it. Behemoths that would threaten entire cities may be felled by a single conductor, who acts with perfect planning and has an encyclopedic knowledge of seemingly every creature in Omnaeus. A report from Guinn that was written by members of the Axiomatic Hivemind stated that conductors are so ruthless in their extraction of energy that they may even remove all memory of a being's existence in the process. Scholars speculate that conductors may be the primary cause of death in celestial societies, though no one can know for certain if conductors are capable of such summary destruction because there are no recorded incidents of anything being erased from history."],

The planet simultaneously rotates as a whole along an inconsistent, tilted axis that exposes different parts of the planet to various amounts of light from Omnaeusâ€™s sun, which is known as the Sunspot. The Sunspot remains stationary. From Omnaeus, it appears to be a great bright ring in the sky, as its center is darker than the rest of it."],
