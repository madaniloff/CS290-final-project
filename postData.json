A conductor always acts within the best interests of the Hivemind. It knows no morals or mercy, and it may gather this energy from any source that will produce it. Conductors typically seek out areas where immensely powerful beings dwell or where major events are taking place, where they then extract energy with frightening precision and efficiency."},

A report from Guinn that was written by members of the Axiomatic Hivemind stated that conductors are so ruthless in their extraction of energy that they may even remove all memory of a being's existence in the process. Scholars speculate that conductors may be the primary cause of death in celestial societies, though no one can know for certain if conductors are capable of such summary destruction because there are no recorded incidents of anything being erased from history."}
