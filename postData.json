In great underground chasms, massive continental-sized gears known as the Inner Machinations turn at a constant rate, tended to by the Axos Legion. The Axos Legion are an army of self-replicating clockworks who operate according to the Grand Design, a set of fundamental rules that was written during the birth of Omnaeus. The exact rulings of the Grand Design are unknown to any but the Axos Legion, but one can extrapolate based on their behavior. One thing is clear: the gears must always turn.",
        "As the gears turn, the northern and southern hemispheres of the planet twist around each other, as if the planet is split evenly from east to west. Anything that would connect the two halves of the planet that is not part of the Inner Machinations is quickly torn asunder as the planet rotates with unfathomable force around a rift known as the Fissure. The planet simultaneously rotates as a whole along an inconsistent, tilted axis that exposes different parts of the planet to various amounts of light from Omnaeusâ€™s sun, which is known as the Sunspot. The Sunspot remains stationary. From Omnaeus, it appears to be a great bright ring in the sky, as its center is darker than the rest of it."],

Many nobles in Guinn have taken to practicing dark, forbidden arts, practicing rhetoric with fiends and sending them against their own armies. The clockworks are indifferent to their masters' actions, and the ensuing battles between devils and machines are viewed as a source of entertainment, with nobles often going to war with one another simply for bragging rights."],
